WhatC-CouldDoThat-Sample
========================

This is the sample code from my &quot;What?!? C# Could Do That?!?&quot; session.
It contains four projects:
- LectureDemos - sample uses of C#'s dynamic keyword.
- RoslynFun - Roslyn project demos.
- RuleEngine - using IronRuby as the language for custom rules in a C# rule engine.
- SamplePlugin - needed for Demo3.cs in the LectureDemos project.

There is no license on this code. You're free to do whatever you want with it.
